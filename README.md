# Geomagnetism rescue lessons for the Iberian Space Science Summer School 2022 (i4s) 
## These are seven lessons prepare in order to understand the basics of the procedure to create the Dst index or any other index that gives an indication of the effects of the ring current on the ground of the Earth

### You can workout the lessons via two options: using your local installation of Python and Jupyter or using Binder (without the need to install Python and Jupyter)
- ### Make a copy of the repository downloading the zip file containing all the code and the data to you local machine (be sure your local machine installation satisfy what it is writen in the file requirements.txt
- ### You can alternatively run the code in a Binder environment on your browser if you click on the following button (the first time will take some minutes)

This repository contains:
- Jupyter notebooks of seven lessons (L01 - L07) that will give you a familiarization with the geomagnetic field disturbances as recorded on the ground and guide you through the process of creating a geomagnetic index. The lessons contain Questions (labeled as Qnn, where nn is the number) and empty space for Answers (labeled as Ann). You can follow the lessons and answer the questions to check your understanding.
- The folder "i4s_geomag_data" with data from four observatories (those used for creating the Dst index, KAK, SJG, HER and HON). The data is contained in daily files covering all the events studied during the i4s school.
- A library with a few functions used on the lessons "i4s_lib.py"
- The requirements.txt file with the minimum packages needed to run the lessons
- This readme file
